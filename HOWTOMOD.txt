Since this game is open, and no files are exactly "hidden", modding "Muffin Dancing" is actually quite easy.

Step 1:
Extract the files: "MuffinDancingFiles.zip" you may need 7-zip or WinRAR.

Step 2: 
Find a video (any video works, needs to be in the .MP4 format), and name it "videoplayback".

Step 3:
Find any audio (again, any audio works, needs to be in the .MP3 format), and name it anything.
(If this doesn't work, name it "Freddy Fazbear's Pizzaera Simulator - Just Add Water"
